Description of the HP modification:
    The enhancement being added is to the ArchiveFileStreamContext class in ArchiveFileStreamContext.cs located in src/DTF/Libraries/Compression, and is part of the Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.dll assembly. A new property, CustomOffsetValue, is added to the class. The functions OpenArchiveReadStream and OpenArchiveWriteStream will make use of the field.

    Original program flow:
        If enableOffsetOption is true, use the built-in offset searcher to determine the offset.

    HP modified program flow:
        If enableOffsetOption is true, check to see if CustomOffsetValue is greater than 0.
        If it is greater than 0, use the value in CustomOffsetValue as the offset for the stream.
        Else, use the built-in offset searcher.
